This project is a collection of documents and recipes showcasing how to install a typical web app infrastructure on a swarm cluster.
It is intended to follow the evolutions of the Docker tools as they are getting more production ready.
We chose to do this demonstration with the ghost blogging plateform and a Posgresql database. The service is load-balanced using haproxy.
